  stellar_evolution.11.desc: "Based on our observations of §H[From.GetName]§!, we believe that it is in the process of turning into a red giant.\n\nNeedless to say, this is even rarer than a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and our scientists are quite excited to observe the evolution of a main sequence star in action."

  stellar_evolution.111.name: "Stellar Evolution: Giants"
  stellar_evolution.111.desc: "Our scientists predict that §H[From.GetName]§! will evolve into a red giant in the next few years."

  stellar_evolution.121.name: "Stellar Evolution: For Science!"
  stellar_evolution.121.desc: "As the knowledge of §H[From.GetName]§!'s imminent evolution spreads, we have been approached by numerous nations requesting access to the star for scientific purposes.\n\nYou can determine how to control access to the star in the policies screen."

  stellar_evolution.211.name: "[From.GetName] Evolves"
  stellar_evolution.211.desc: "Our scientists inform us that §H[From.GetName]§! has evolved and should now be classified as a red giant."
