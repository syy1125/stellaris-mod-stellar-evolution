  stellar_evolution.101.name: "Observing Evolving Stars"
  stellar_evolution.101.desc: "As we now control a site of active stellar evolution, our scientists are eager to observe it in greater detail. We have already received design proposals for a §Y$sm_stellar_evolution_observatory$§! starbase building.\n\nIn addition, there are numerous requests from other nations asking to observe evolving stars in our borders. We should decide how to respond to those requests using the §Y$policy_stellar_evolution_access$§! policy."

  stellar_evolution.1011.name: "[From.GetName] Approaches Main Sequence Turn-Off"
  stellar_evolution.1011.desc: "Based on observations of §H[From.GetName]§!, we believe that its core has nearly used up all of its hydrogen. Stellar evolution models predict that we should begin to see noticable changes within a decade or two."

  stellar_evolution.1111.name: "Detectable Signs of Stellar Evolution in [From.GetName]"
  stellar_evolution.1111.desc: "Instruments monitoring §H[From.GetName]§! have confirmed signs of stellar evolution.\n\nNeedless to say, the [Root.GetAdj] scientific community is quite excited to see an evolving star in action."

  stellar_evolution.1211.name: "[From.GetName] Begins Leaving The Main Sequence"
  stellar_evolution.1211.desc: "A ripple of excitement spreads through the [Root.GetAdj] scientific community today, as §H[From.GetName]§! begins evolving. Although the change is not discernable to the naked eye yet, our high-precision instruments confirm that §H[From.GetName]§! is definitely leaving the main sequence.\n\nThough high-mass stars evolve relatively fast, it is still a process that happens over hundreds if not thousands of years, so from our perspective the star would only change slightly in size and color over time.\n\nFortunately, high-mass stars tend to maintain constant luminosity as they traverse the giant branch, so our assets in the system should remain unaffected."

  stellar_evolution.2011.name: "Helium Flash Imminent"
  stellar_evolution.2011.desc: "A recent calculation by leading experts in stellar evolution indicate that §H[From.GetName]§!'s hydrogen shell burning has reached a critical stage. The star is projected to experience a helium flash in the next 3-5 years.\n\n§YIf possible, we should send a fully crewed science ship to the system to observe the event.§!"

  stellar_evolution.2111.name: "Helium Flash Occurs In [From.GetName]"
  stellar_evolution.2111.desc: "Our science ship in the [From.System.GetName] has just observed a spike of neutrino emissions from [From.GetName], confirming that helium fusion has begun in its core.\n\nWhile it is unlikely that the star will exhibit any visible change for centries to come, the data collected from this event has already improved our understanding of the stellar evolution process."

  stellar_evolution.2112.name: "$stellar_evolution.2111.name$"
  stellar_evolution.2112.desc: "We have received reports confirming that the helium flash has occurred in [From.GetName]."

  policy_stellar_evolution_access_desc: "Should a stellar evolution event occur in our borders, other nations are bound to wish to observe. We must decide how to treat such science teams from other nations.\nThis will also affect the output of our §Y$sm_stellar_evolution_observatory$§!."
